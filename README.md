## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development mode (runs backend, frontend, and electron)
npm run dev

# Or run individual components:
npm run start:backend    # Start Express API server
npm run start:frontend   # Start React development server
npm run electron         # Start Electron app (after frontend is running)
```

*Clean, modern interface with single-row game display*

</div>

## üéÆ 3D Game Cover Showcase

The app features fully 3D game covers that you can rotate and interact with. Each cover is rendered as a complete 3D mesh with proper depth and lighting.
